## Tech Stack

This project uses a modern web development stack to ensure high performance and maintainability:

### Frontend

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library used to build the app’s user interface, providing seamless interactions and a dynamic single-page experience.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: For a responsive, aesthetically pleasing layout that adjusts based on screen size and device type, with styling influenced by high-end fitness brands.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend, handling data efficiently and enabling smooth interaction between the client and server.

### Backend

- **Node.js** & **Express**: The core of the backend, enabling efficient handling of requests and responses. Express simplifies the server setup and API routing.
- **RESTful API**: The backend is designed as a REST API, allowing for easy data access and manipulation via HTTP requests. Each workout can be created, updated, deleted, and fetched with precision.
- **UUID**: Used to generate unique identifiers for each workout and exercise, ensuring data integrity.

### Deployment

- **Render**: Both the frontend and backend are deployed on Render, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting. Render’s integration makes it easy to keep the app online and responsive.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: a frontend React application and a backend API built with Express.

- **Frontend**: Focuses on displaying workout data, providing an interactive and appealing UI, and sending requests to the backend API.
- **Backend**: Handles data storage, retrieval, and processing of workout routines, making it accessible via RESTful endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following key endpoints:

- `GET /api/workouts`: Retrieve a list of all workouts.
- `GET /api/workouts/:id`: Get details for a specific workout.
- `POST /api/workouts`: Add a new workout to the collection.
- `PUT /api/workouts/:id`: Update an existing workout.
- `DELETE /api/workouts/:id`: Remove a workout from the collection.

The API is designed to be extendable, enabling additional features to be implemented in the future.
